<h1 id= "EVOLUTION"> HTML EVOLUTION </h1>
<p> HTML is a derivative of SGML and was born in 1991, thanks to Tim 
Berners-Lee (who worked at CERN), who, faced with the need to share 
information among scientists, created the first definition of the language.
Tim Berners Lee defined the first version of HTML in 1989. It would later 
evolve to four more versions. HTML 4 was the latest in 1998 </p>
<h1 id= "WHATIS"> What is HTML? </h1>
<p> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's 
appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript). </p>
<h1 id= "History"> HTML History </h1>
<p> The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999.

Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML).

HTML 1.0: was the first version of HTML, used from 1989 to 1994. It was a very limited version and included only 20 elements. There wasn’t much that could be done with it and therefore most webpages ended up looking very similar due to the inability to do things such as; alter the page background, determine fonts and use tables and forms.

 HTML 2.0: Created in 1995, this version was a significant improvement to HTML 1.0. “HTML 2.0 becomes the first official set of standards for HTML — the base standard by which all browsers were measured until HTML 3.2.” (Bartels, 2011). It was able to support the changing of a page background, text colour, text face, the use of tables and text boxes etc. It was around this time that W3C (The World Wide Web Consortium) was created — an organisation which develops web standards. 
HTML 2.0 also started to support more browsers.

HTML 3.2 : In January 1997 HTML 3.2 was endorsed by the W3 Consortium and approved of by many, including significant browsers such as Netscape and Microsoft. 
“HTML 3.2 included tables, applets, text flow around images, subscripts and superscripts.” (W3.org, 1998).

HTML 4.01: This version of HTML, created in 1999, included cascading style sheets (css) which allowed aspects such as text, colour, font and backgrounds to be easily altered.
 Instead of these aspects being included directly within the webpage, they are now separated, making it much more trouble-free.


HTML 5: is the current version of HTML which is used. “We’ve come a long way since HTML could barely handle a simple page layout. HTML5 can be used to write web applications that still work when you’re not connected to the net; 
to tell websites where you are physically located; to handle high definition video; and to deliver extraordinary graphics.”
